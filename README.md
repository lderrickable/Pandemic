Pandemic
Game design by Matt Leacock <br>
Coded adaptation by Luke Derrick<br>
<br>
**Note: This code is not representative how I would architect this application today. It was one of the first projects I'd ever coded in a programming language, so best practices weren't really on mind at the time.**<br>
<br>
This project is not intended for distribution. It is only available as an example of my work and as an addendum to my resume. In order to open and play the game, dowload all files and open index.html in a browser. I have not written a tutorial setting for the game, so understanding the UI may take some fiddling around. However, I believe it's fairly self explanatory if one knows how to play Pandemic. Finally, the most important file in this project is index.js, which is composed of one large AngularJS controller. Index.js is also heavily commented for anyone trying to understand the inner workings of this game. <br>
